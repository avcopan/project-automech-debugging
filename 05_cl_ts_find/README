### Context

We found that what we thought was the IRC for this abstraction reaction was actually an
IRC from one van der Waals complex to another. Optimizing the final point of the original IRC found a local minimum, representing a Cl ... H van der Waals complex.

Implication: It seems that the default Cl ... H distance for TS searching was too close
in the original TS search, and this is why it failed to find the saddle point.

Approach: I am trying to modify the default Cl ... H distance for H abstraction
scans to see if I can find the right value.
